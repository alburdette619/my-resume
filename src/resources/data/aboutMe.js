  bio: [
    `
      I graduated college in 2007 with a BSE in Mechatronics.  Sadly, this was not a good time to
      graduate and attempt to enter the professional world.  After a few years I managed to get a
      job as a manual software tester at Trident Micro Systems.  I'd worked there for about six
      months when they started a new team and I got them to take a chance on me learning to code.  I
      learned C# and WPF while being a junior developer.  I wrote a lot of the front end for a
      dispatch desktop application that communicated with our radio controllers to gather telemetry 
      data and provide texting and vocal communications to individuals and groups.
    `,
    `
      I continued working on desktop apps in C# through 2015 but noticed that the tide seemed to be
      turning away from that market.  That's when a friend got me my current job at Market America.
      There I started with about a year of native Android development before moving on to
      JavaScript.  It seemed like a breath of fresh air after the verbosity of Java.  I haven't
      looked back since.  In late 2016 my direct report, Trevor (@trevorbrindlejs), asked me to 
      create a project in React Native.  I wound up making a small one off app not quite knowing 
      what I was doing but I very much enjoyed the framework.  Together with Trevor, we started 
      migrating the team over to learning React Native and got the go ahead to green field our
      current apps.
    `,
    `
      React Native is the first framework in a while that has made me want to get more involved. I
      want to create and contribute to open source and become a RN core contributor.  I want to
      continue attending Chain React and other conferences to network and learn from the best.
      Finding the  time is another story with a family of four, but I do what I can and hope to 
      start strengthening my GitHub profile.
    `,
    `
      My dream job would be a remote job with a company that's passionate about software, continuing
      education, encourages conference attendance and speaking, and has a good work/life balance.
